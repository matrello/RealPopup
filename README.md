# RealPopup
RealPopup replaces the old winpopup with a full featured freeware tool, simple and stable as its predecessor. It was a project started back in 1998 and ended in 2005, collecting more than 400k downloads and great reviews on the most important software sites. The latest official package v2.6 build 167 published in 2005 is availableÂ [here] (https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmFxtJaUmKoFiYsdFc_4M9zbN7OpMg).

Warning: SMB and NetMessageBufferSend API usage came from reverse engineering, do not take my code as official or worse as a guideline! :)

# Beware of 'new' RealPopup paid software!
My freeware RealPopup has nothing to do with the product currently being sold on realpopup.it, matro.it and other software download sites: in 2011 these guys took ownership of my domains and brand without permission. It's sad to realize how free effort is abused, with such lack of good ideas and intentions.
